          My name is Andrew Bliach (rhymes with Biatch) and I was born in New Jersey, the same place I was raised. I’m taking this course because I’ve always considered myself terribly inadept at understanding and using computers-this course is to prove myself wrong (and grow a very relevant skill-set I hope to one day make employable).

          That is a common theme in my life; immersing myself in experiences that are uncomfortable. I’m convinced it’s the only way to grow and to learn. Relevant to these points is my love of learning. I get off on that stuff. Whether it’s about space rocks, new and old science, computer coding, or the rare and elusive snow leopard, I’m all in.

          Some more facts about me: I majored in Philosophy at Rutgers. I work right now in Human Resources at a Home Health Aid Agency. I thoroughly enjoying puzzling something out, whether it be a recipe (really enjoy doing that because I can eat my progress), a problem a friend has, or a chess match. There is an undeniable satisfaction from figuring out the solution to a problem. Another big reason I’m in this course is because of that realization. I’d like to engage in professional work which tickles that nerve, or at the least has me chasing a solution and the satisfaction that comes with it. Another thing I consider important about myself: I love music. I sang in my highschool a cappella group, and with Rutgers a cappella as well. I’ve been in a few crappy bands, though despite my lack of gauges or a funky hairdo I was once deep in that world. Nowadays, I’m basically a sixty-five-year-old man. I never use command S, I drive just 5 miles over the speed limit, and I usually go to sleep by 10:30. Here’s to getting out of the comfort zone!
